A Rust workspace with several useful libraries to work with Decentraland

For more information see README.md in each library

This project exists thanks to the Decentraland DAO's grants. [Here is our proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1959b490-f726-11ec-805c-77efd746e6b7). We're eternally grateful that we can make this happen thanks to the Decentraland community.
