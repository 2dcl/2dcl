A Rust workspace with several useful libraries to work with Decentraland

For more information see README.md in each library

This project exists thanks to the Decentraland DAO's grants. [Here is our proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1959b490-f726-11ec-805c-77efd746e6b7). We're eternally grateful that we can make this happen thanks to the Decentraland community.


## In this repository

1. `common` — A collection of types used in multiple projects.
2. `catalyst` — Rust client library for Decentraland's Catalyst API
3. `kernel` — A rust-based kernel launcher using [wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry) for cross-platform webview use.
4. `protcol`  — [Decentraland's protocol](https://github.com/decentraland/protocol) protobuf classes compiled for Rust usage.
